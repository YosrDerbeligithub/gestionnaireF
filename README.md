# GestionnaireF

**GestionnaireF** is a web application developed for my **final year project** (Projet de fin d'ann√©e). It is a comprehensive training cycle management system for educational or professional training environments. The system allows administrators to manage training cycles, manage trainers, and handle participant registrations, among other features.

## Key Features:

- **Administrator Authentication**: The administrator must authenticate to access the management interface. They can also update their personal information within the system.
  
- **Training Cycle Management**: The administrator can create, modify, and delete training cycles. This includes defining the schedule, location, and other cycle details.
  
- **Training Management**: The administrator can manage available training sessions, including adding, modifying, and deleting training courses.
  
- **Trainer Management**: The administrator can manage trainers by adding, modifying, and deleting their information, ensuring that the right experts are assigned to each training cycle.
  
- **Participant Search**: Registered participants can be searched based on the start date of a training cycle or the theme of a training course.
  
- **Participant Registration**: Participants can directly register for a training cycle via the website, streamlining the enrollment process.
  
- **Well-Structured Database**: All information is stored in a well-organized database, facilitating easy access, updates, and data security.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Bootstrap for responsive design)
- **Backend**: PHP for server-side logic
- **Database**: MySQL for managing data on training cycles, participants, trainers, etc.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration.
